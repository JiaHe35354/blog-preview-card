## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced:

- Using :root CSS variables for color theming

- Applying Flexbox for centering component and for layout and spacing between avatar and caption

- Managing responsive font sizes and layouts using em units in media queries

Here's an example of centering a component with Flexbox I used:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Here's an example of a responsive media query I used:

```css
@media (max-width: 28.75em) {
  html {
    font-size: 50%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Add focus-visible states for better usability

- Learn more about scalable design systems with reusable components

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me for centering a component. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN: Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
